# CODEX WORKLOG

Purpose: append one compact entry after each Codex pass so future sessions can reconstruct what changed without relying on chat history.

---

## 2026-04-04 — Variant 2 operating layer bootstrap

### Goal
Add the missing operating-layer documents required for the ChatGPT ↔ user ↔ Codex workflow so the repository can function as a true source-of-truth project system instead of relying on manual chat transfer.

### Files created
- `01_MASTER/SSOT_MAP.md`
- `05_CODEX/NEXT_TASK.md`
- `05_CODEX/CODEX_WORKLOG.md`
- `05_CODEX/IMPLEMENTATION_RULES.md`
- `05_CODEX/HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md`

### What was done
- Added an explicit source-of-truth map for navigation and conflict resolution.
- Added a single active `NEXT_TASK.md` packet for the next bounded Codex step.
- Added this running worklog so each future pass can append structured outcomes.
- Added implementation rules that force Codex to respect scope, SSOT files, and documentation updates.
- Added a handoff template so future results arrive in a consistent structure.

### What was not changed
- Existing master documents were not rewritten.
- The historical long-form `TASKS.md` ledger was preserved.
- Runtime code, desktop shell code, module docs, and tech schemas were not touched.

### Why this matters
The repository already had strong architecture and documentation. The main missing layer was operational: there was no explicit SSOT map, no single current task packet, and no structured Codex handoff log. Those gaps caused unnecessary manual transfer between chats.

### Remaining gap after this step
- `00_INDEX.md` still does not link these new operating documents.
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `TASKS.md` do not yet explicitly mention the new Variant 2 operating mode.
- The next Codex pass should execute the audit described in `05_CODEX/NEXT_TASK.md` and then synchronize the state files.

### Recommended next step
Run the bounded product-value audit defined in `05_CODEX/NEXT_TASK.md`, select one strongest next slice, then update `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `TASKS.md`, and this worklog in the same pass.
