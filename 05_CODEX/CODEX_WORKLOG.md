# CODEX WORKLOG

Purpose: append one compact entry after each Codex pass so future sessions can reconstruct what changed without relying on chat history.

---

## 2026-04-04 — Variant 2 operating layer bootstrap

### Goal
Add the missing operating-layer documents required for the ChatGPT ↔ user ↔ Codex workflow so the repository can function as a true source-of-truth project system instead of relying on manual chat transfer.

### Files created
- `01_MASTER/SSOT_MAP.md`
- `05_CODEX/NEXT_TASK.md`
- `05_CODEX/CODEX_WORKLOG.md`
- `05_CODEX/IMPLEMENTATION_RULES.md`
- `05_CODEX/HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md`

### What was done
- Added an explicit source-of-truth map for navigation and conflict resolution.
- Added a single active `NEXT_TASK.md` packet for the next bounded Codex step.
- Added this running worklog so each future pass can append structured outcomes.
- Added implementation rules that force Codex to respect scope, SSOT files, and documentation updates.
- Added a handoff template so future results arrive in a consistent structure.

### What was not changed
- Existing master documents were not rewritten.
- The historical long-form `TASKS.md` ledger was preserved.
- Runtime code, desktop shell code, module docs, and tech schemas were not touched.

### Why this matters
The repository already had strong architecture and documentation. The main missing layer was operational: there was no explicit SSOT map, no single current task packet, and no structured Codex handoff log. Those gaps caused unnecessary manual transfer between chats.

### Remaining gap after this step
- `00_INDEX.md` still does not link these new operating documents.
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `TASKS.md` do not yet explicitly mention the new Variant 2 operating mode.
- The next Codex pass should execute the audit described in `05_CODEX/NEXT_TASK.md` and then synchronize the state files.

### Recommended next step
Run the bounded product-value audit defined in `05_CODEX/NEXT_TASK.md`, select one strongest next slice, then update `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `TASKS.md`, and this worklog in the same pass.

## 2026-04-04 — Variant 2 sync and next-slice audit

### Goal
Synchronize the repository with the new Variant 2 operating layer, run the bounded post-snapshot-authoring audit, and choose one strongest next coding slice without drifting into runtime churn, recovery-tail polish, media workflow, dashboards, mentor logic, mobile, or sync.

### Files created
- `05_CODEX/BILL_WILLIAMS_REVIEW_EVIDENCE_STATUS.md`

### Files updated
- `00_INDEX.md`
- `01_MASTER/CURRENT_STATE.md`
- `05_CODEX/TASKS.md`
- `05_CODEX/NEXT_TASK.md`
- `05_CODEX/CODEX_WORKLOG.md`

### What was done
- Synced `00_INDEX.md` with `SSOT_MAP.md` and the new Variant 2 operating-layer documents so the repository itself now exposes the active operating stack.
- Ran a bounded audit after desktop chart snapshot authoring and rejected low-value candidates such as more recovery-tail polish, more symbolic Bill Williams label chaining, and dashboard-like session-summary expansion.
- Selected `Bill Williams Review Evidence Status` as the strongest next slice because it gives snapshot authoring direct training value inside the current review loop.
- Added one new implementation-facing document for that slice and promoted it into the active task packet as `T-102`.
- Updated `CURRENT_STATE.md` and the long-form `TASKS.md` ledger so the next frontier is explicit in repository state instead of chat memory.

### What was not changed
- Runtime code was not changed.
- Desktop shell code was not changed.
- Tests were not changed.
- Module contracts and tech schemas were not changed.
- `DECISIONS.md` was not changed because the audit did not require a new project-level decision.

### Why this matters
The project had already closed the recovery-tail and made chart snapshots usable from desktop authoring. The next strongest user-visible gain was to connect that snapshot context to the quality of Bill Williams review instead of adding more surfaces or more labels. This keeps the post-MVP track product-facing and bounded.

### Remaining gap after this step
- `Bill Williams Review Evidence Status` is now defined but not yet implemented in runtime, desktop projections, or tests.
- The next Codex pass should execute `T-102` directly from `NEXT_TASK.md` and keep the implementation strictly derive-on-read and current-session scoped.

### Recommended next step
Implement `T-102: Bill Williams Review Evidence Status Slice`.
